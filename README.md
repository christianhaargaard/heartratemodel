Code by: Christian Haargaard Olsen

Consists of three directories:

* c/: Where the c library lives. You might need to change the Makefile to reflect where sundials is installed on your system
* python/: There might be some errors in there, as the code is old. I tried cleaning it up but didn't have a python2.7-installation with scipy working to test it.
* data/: One data file for use with the model. It's used in python/solution.py I believe.

Good luck! Let me know if you have questions!

Cheers,
Christian
